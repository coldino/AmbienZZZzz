## Tech Used

This project uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as a base framework as a provides a comfortable environment and ridiculously easy deployment options. On top of this it integrates [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) - an alternative to Tailwind with a few more features - which provides all of the CSS utilities needed to style the project.

Other than that, this project is pure TypeScript and HTML5.

Tools used during creation include Audacity, Inkscape, Canva and GIMP.

little parts cut out that would have destroyed the immersion of being an ongoing ambient track
(e.g. coughing, yelling, phone handling).
