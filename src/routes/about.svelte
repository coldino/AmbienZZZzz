		<p>
			AmbienZZZzz is an easy to use ambient sound mixer. No matter if you want to focus on your work
			or fall asleep. It is proven that certain sounds help you gain focus by raising the
			hearing threshold when constantly playing.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			You can either choose to listen to one sound or mix it up as you want. If you want to try out
			the pre-made scenes, just click on the blue buttons below. You can always adjust all volumes
			to your liking.
		</p>
		<br />
		<small>
			PS: AmbienZZZzz can also be used to enhance storytelling. Impress your next DnD party with
			high quality ambient sounds.
